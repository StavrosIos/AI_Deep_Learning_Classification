# AI_Deep_Learning_Classification

For the chosen topic, a subset of the COCO dataset will be considered, consisting approximately of 67000 images and their annotations from the class ‘person’. The whole dataset is publicly available in the following link, http://cocodataset.org/#download [1]
The filtered dataset was derived after creating two scripts. Initially we downloaded the whole Coco dataset and we applied code to draw out only the images that were annotated with the “person” category. In like manner, the annotations from images that do not exist had to be removed, since we realised that we cannot apply any training in our models if images and annotations do not match.
